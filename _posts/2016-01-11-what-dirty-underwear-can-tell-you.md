Have you ever thought about washing underwear -- someone else's? 

Once I heard
a funny story with a good lesson. It was about a young woman in a serious
relationship who developed a big crush on another guy. Nothing was wrong with
her existing relationship. But she was really attracted to this other guy, and
didn't know what to do.

"I'm young, I need to follow my instincts, try new things," she
thought. She talked to a few friends, and most of them said she should have a
fling.

"He'll never know, and if you don't, you'll always wonder what might
have happened." Most likely you've heard this argument before. It's
actually a pretty good argument.

She thought and thought. But then, she imagined herself washing her crush's
dirty underwear. Just think: stinky stains in the front. Skid marks in the back. The idea put her off. 

For some reason, she would consider
hopping in the sack with him, but found the idea of doing something ordinary, a
part of day-to-day life, distasteful. 

Her crush evaporated. She did not sleep with him, and went on to enjoy a
long, happy relationship with her partner.

What does this silly little story tell us?

* Physical attraction is not
all there is to a relationship
* Real relationships involve
mundane things in life, like washing underwear
* If you're looking for
something beyond the physical, start thinking about those mundane things
with that person. Still appealing?

To be honest, I have no idea if this is a true story or not. I don't even
know where I heard it. But I think about it a lot. It applies for both sexes.
For a guy, the equivilent might be buying tampons for a girlfriend. For you, it
might be something else. 

It doesn't really matter what it is, as long as it works for you. Next time
you're about to take the next step, think about what little things you'd be
willing to do -- or not -- for that person.

It's that simple.
