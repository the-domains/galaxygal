How would you like to blow your girl's mind with your cultural savvy? You can do it in less than an hour by making Ukrainian Easter eggs. 

All you have to do is boil up a few eggs in onion skins. You know, that papery reddish-brown stuff on the outside of onions. If you're smart, you throw that stuff away after chopping up an onion.

Don't cook? Don't worry. Just buy some onions, peel off the skins, and throw the inside of the onions away. Yes, you'll be wasting food in a pretty stupid way. But sometimes sacrifices have to be made when building up your credentials.

Here's what I suggest you do:

1\. [Get complete and detailed instructions][0] on making Ukrainian Easter eggs with onion-skin dye.

2\. Make the eggs and put them in a bowl on your kitchen table. 

3\. Let your girl "discover" them. Wait for the inevitable question.

4\. Answer casually: "Oh, its our family tradition to make Easter eggs out of onions. I like to keep up traditions. My grandmother from Ukraine (fill in any exotic country name here).

Watch her admiration grow before your very eyes. You've (i) shown you're not afraid of the kitchen; (ii) displayed international cultural sensitivity; and (iii) demonstrated respect for traditions. 

Girls like that stuff. Believe me, I know: it worked on me, more than once. Let me know how it works out for you.
