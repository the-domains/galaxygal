If your budget is tight and you care about your health, consider the lowly bean.

Here's why: beans are nutritious, healthy, and easy to prepare. Really. And if your partner has even the faintest interest in vegetarianism, you're sure to get lucky, farts notwithstanding.

Beans are legumes, which are edible seeds that grow in a pod. There are many kinds, including lentils, chickpeas, and tons of others. Even peanuts are technically a bean. No matter what size or shape they come in, each bean is a magical little package of nutrients. 

Consider these benefits:

* **No cholesterol**. You may be young now, but as you get older, you'll have to worry about cholesterol clogging up your vascular system. 
* **High fiber**. You need this to keep your bowels healthy.  Think that's an old man's problem? Think again. It also slows down the digestive process, which is a good thing.
* **Low fat**. This isn't as scary as it was in the 1980s but you still need to watch your fat intake. Fat carries a powerful caloric punch. 
* **High protein**. You need protein to build up muscle. And hormones. Don't forget about the hormones.
* **High in complex carbs**, which provide long-lasting energy.

On top of that, they're are versatile and easy to cook, provided you remember to soak them. If that's too hard for you, just open a can. You can find plenty of [good recipes for beans][0] online.

But what about gas? This is caused by a big sugar molecule your body can't handle. It ends up in your gut and is chewed up by bacteria, producing gas. But you can handle this easily: just add some vinegar to the water when you're soaking your beans (about 1/4  works fine). This helps break down the sugar before it gets inside you.
