If you're single and on the market, the best thing you can do to improve your prospects is start your day with a dump. Then take a shower. Immediately.

Why is this important? No matter how many times you wipe, your ass will still be filthy. Don't believe me? OK, trying wiping with a bare hand and give it the sniff test. 

How did that turn out?

So listen up. You can't afford to put your bowels in the driver's seat when it comes to Number Two. For the rest of the day -- and crucially, the night -- your ass will carry its scent with you. If you end up in the sack, that scent could haunt you.

I learned this lesson the hard way. During an intimate moment in college, my partner said something like, "let's change position, I can smell your ass." Needless to say, that killed the moment. But I knew I had to make a lifestyle change.

So what should you do instead? Show your intestines who's boss: train yourself to take a dump first thing in the morning. Then take your shower. It's not as hard as it sounds --it's kind of like breaking in a horse. Just show your intestines who's boss. Get on the toilet with your iPad or your phone and stay there until your business is done. After a week or two, your body will adapt and everything will come out when you want it to.

Even if you're not planning some loving, this approach has benefits. Say goodbye to embarrassing tread marks. Say goodbye to stinky laundry. Banish dingleberries forever. You won't regret it.

Best of all is going about your day with the confidence that everything inside your pants is in order. 

Don't believe me? Do it anyway. You'll thank me later.
