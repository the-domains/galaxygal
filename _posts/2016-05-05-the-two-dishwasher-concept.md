Dishwashers may save us a lot of hard labor, but there's still work involved: you have to load and then unload all the dishes. Like most parents, I assigned dishwasher duty to my kids. They bitched about it for years -- one of them still does.

One of them had an idea: get two dishwashers! They serve as cupboards: you take clean dishes from one, use them, and put them in the other. Of course there will be some supply/demand mismatch, but a much smaller cupboard could take care of that.

As a closet minimalist, I've always liked the idea. I wonder how it would work in practice.
